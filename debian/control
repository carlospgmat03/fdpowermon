Description: simple battery power monitor for laptops with ACPI
 fdpowermon is a simple perl script that installs an icon in a system
 tray compatible with the freedesktop.org specification.
 .
 Every three seconds, fdpowermon calls acpi to find out what the current
 battery level is. It will set the output of the acpi command as a
 tooltip text, and will update the used icon as appropriate.
 .
 It has no other 'features' like trying to manage your processor speed
 or display backlight for you, preferring to let other subsystems (or
 none at all) do that for you.

Description: icons for fdpowermon
 fdpowermon is a simple perl script that installs an icon in a system
 tray compatible with the freedesktop.org specification.
 .
 By default, it uses an icon set from the 'oxygen' icon theme. However,
 that icon set is fairly large (several tens of megabytes), which is a
 waste if the oxygen-icon-theme package is not installed for other
 reasons. Therefore, this package contains just those icons from the
 oxygen-icon-theme package that are needed by fdpowermon, and nothing
 more.
